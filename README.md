<a id="installation"></a>
## Installation
User would need to run npm i to install everything listed in package.json. Would also need postgreSQL for the database.

<a id="usage"></a>
## Usage
This code would be good for products held in a database. Making it easy to keep track of what the user has for inventory and stock. This is just the backend though so will need to incorporate a UI.
